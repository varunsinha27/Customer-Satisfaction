# Customer-Satisfaction

As we know that airline sector was one of the worst hit sectors due to COVID. They suffered a 
loss of $371 billion in 2020 and soon after the resumption of services, all the airline companies have 
been working hard to revive the industry. Customers are one whom we can say are a major contributor 
to the revenue generated by companies. So, it is very important to understand the customerâ€™s pain points 
and focus on improving their service to increase customer satisfaction. The objective here was to 
identify the factors leading to customer satisfaction. By thinking of myself as a customer, services 
provided during flight and at the airport, flight delays, and staff cooperation to deal with customers were 
some of the factors I thought will be important for my satisfaction. 
In the following sections, we will discuss the dataset and visual techniques which can be used 
to effectively and easily understand the historical data and the factors affecting satisfaction then we will 
implement classification-based ML models to predict customer satisfaction and select the best fit model 
based on metric scores.
